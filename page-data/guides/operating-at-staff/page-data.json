That's absolutely the opposite of what happens!\n- <a href=\"/stories/katie-sylor-miller\">Katie Sylor-Miller</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many engineers become focused on the Staff-plus career path because the engineering manager path has too many meetings or requires too much collaboration with other coworkers… and woah are you going to be surprised if you begin a Staff-plus with that mindset. Although Staff Engineer roles are generally positioned as the sequential step beyond Senior Engineer, it’s genuinely a different role and you’ll increasingly spend your time doing sorts of work that you previously did infrequently or not-at-all.</p>\n<p>There is a significant learning-curve in Staff-plus roles that initially trips most folks up.\nPart of the challenge is that much of the  work you're doing has a much slower feedback cycle.\nThe delayed feedback can initially feel quite demoralizing as you replace the visceral coding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\">REPL</a> with the uneven progress of mentorship, relationship building, and strategy.</p>\n<p>This chapter is about overcoming that learning-curve,\nlearning to operate as a Staff Engineer, and\nfinding the parts of the role which are personally fulfilling and organizationally transformative.</p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>In the interviews for this book, as well as my own experience leading and coaching Staff-plus engineers, a handful of topics kept coming up as keystones of personal development. They aren’t <em>everything</em> you’ll do in the role, but they are the places where you’re most likely to have an outsized impact or accidentally commit a career-limiting move.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters\">Work on what matters</a></strong> to make the most of the working hours you have,\nparticularly as you get further along in your career and life's commitments expand.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/engineering-strategy\">Writing an engineering strategy</a></strong> to guide your organization’s approach to supporting your company’s business objectives with its architecture, technology selection, and organizational structure.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/manage-technical-quality\">Curating technical quality</a></strong> to maintain the quality of your company’s architecture and software as it grows and tacks over time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://staffeng.com/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority\">Stay aligned with authority</a></strong> to remain an effective leader over time.\nTechnical leadership roles rely on proxied authority from another (usually, managerial) leader, and continued access to that authority\ndepends on staying aligned, trustworthy, and predictable.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://staffeng.com/guides/to-lead-follow\">To lead, you have to follow</a></strong>.

That said, these won’t cover everything you do. At times you’ll find your role surprisingly similar to that of an Engineering Director, and at other times strangely familiar to previous work in your career.</p>\n<p>That extraordinarily broad remit is part of what makes describing these roles challenging, and if there’s a particular topic you’re focused on that’s missing, check out the <a href=\"https://staffeng.com/guides/learning-materials\">Additional resources for learning</a> appendix.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 28, 2020","slug":"/guides/operating-at-staff","name":null,"role":null,"kind":"guide","title":"Operating at Staff"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/guides/operating-at-staff"}}}
