More than a dozen Staff-plus engineers across the industry\nwere kind enough to share their experiences of reaching and operating in a Staff-plus role.\nTheir wisdom has created something richer in nuance, breadth, and perspective than I could have ever written on my own.</p>\n<p>If you're already in a Staff-plus role, I hope these writings will energize you in your\njourney as a leader outside the management track. If you aim for such a role, I hope\nthis book will provide pragmatic aid in its pursuit.</p>\n<p>You can read this book cover to cover, but please jump around if you want. There's no right or wrong way to read it.</p>\n<p>Its sections are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/overview-overview\">Overview</a></strong> - a survey of the Staff engineer role, how it varies by company, and why the title matters</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/operating-at-staff\">Operating at Staff</a></strong> - how to do  the work on the other side of the title</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/getting-the-title-where-you-are\">Getting the title where you are</a></strong> - how to attain a Staff-plus role at your current company</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/deciding-to-switch\">Switching companies to get the title</a></strong> - when and how changing companies can support the pursuit of a Staff-plus title</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/stories\">Stories</a></strong> - collected stories from Staff-plus engineers about what they do and how they reached their role</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/learning-materials\">Resources</a></strong> - a collection of templates and further readings if you're looking for more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every company puts its spin on Staff-plus roles, so it's likely that some parts won't map to your experience.\nIf that's the case, please take what resonates and discard the rest!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 21, 2020","slug":"/guides/overview-overview","name":null,"role":null,"kind":"guide","title":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/guides/overview-overview"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249418449","2906657295","762788943"],"slicesMap":{}}
