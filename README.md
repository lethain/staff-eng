This repository is a Gatsby script that is built into [staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com).
The built assets live in the `ghpage` branch.

## Submitting your story?

Read the instructions at [staffeng.com/share](https://staffeng.com/share),
but it's basically submitting a story to `src/markdown` in the same format
as the existing stories!

## Development

[Install Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/get-started/), then run:

    gatsby develop

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Please run prettier on all code before submit a request:

    prettier --write src/*/*.js

After that send over a pull request.

##  Deploy

Roughly following [these instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/):

    npm run deploy

Longer term I'd like to figure out how to get CI/CD setup using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions)
and these [gatsby deploy instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/).
Or maybe [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action)? Although I think that one assumes a different
branch structure, which is fine.
