that there&rsquo;s no reason not to read a half-dozen different ones before

Some that are particularly worth reading through:

Rent the Runway
Kickstarter
Patreon

You can find even more collected at progression.fyi.
Charity Majors has also written a helpful guide of things to know about engineering levels.
I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize that career ladders only apply effectively against
populations of individuals. They rarely, if ever, apply cleanly against any individual.
This effect becomes particularly pronounced in Staff-plus roles, which are often only
populated by a couple of folks. Ladders are essential but don&rsquo;t get caught believing
they&rsquo;re a map of how things actually work rather than a mythos of how things are intended to work."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.146.6"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="map[name:Will Larson]"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/static/pygments.css><link rel=canonical href=https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-career-ladders/><meta property="og:url" content="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-career-ladders/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track"><meta property="og:title" content="Staff-plus career ladders"><meta property="og:description" content="There are so many different career ladders shared in public these days that there’s no reason not to read a half-dozen different ones before attempting to design your own.
