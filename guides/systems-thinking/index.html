We want to describe events causally&ndash;our managers are too busy because we&rsquo;re trying to ship our current project&ndash;but few events occur in a vacuum.</p><p>Big changes appear to happen in a moment, but if you look closely underneath the big change, there is usually
a slow accumulation of small changes.
In this example, perhaps the managers are busy because no one hired and trained the managers required to support this year&rsquo;s project deadlines. These accumulations are called <em>stocks</em>, and are the memory of changes over time. A stock might be the number of trained managers at your company.</p><p>Changes to stocks are called <em>flows</em>. These can be either <em>inflows</em> or <em>outflows</em>. Training a new manager is an inflow, and a trained manager who departs the company is an outflow. Diagrams in this article represent flows with solid dark lines.</p><p><img src=/static/systems/sys-loop-clouds.png alt="System diagram for hiring and training new managers."></p><p>The other relationship, represented in this article by a dashed line, is an <em>information link</em>. These indicate that the value of a stock is a factor in the size of a flow. Indicated in this diagram by a dashed line. The link here shows that the time available for developing features depends on the number of trained managers.</p><p>Often stocks outside of a diagrams scope will be represented as a cloud, indicating that there is something complex that happened there that we&rsquo;re not currently exploring. It&rsquo;s best practice to label every flow, and to keep in mind that every flow is a rate, whereas every stock is a quantity.</p><h2 id=developer-velocity>Developer velocity</h2><p>When I started thinking of a useful example of where systems thinking is useful, one came to mind immediately.
Since reading Forsgren&rsquo;s <a href=https://lethain.com/accelerate-developer-productivity/>Accelerate</a> earlier this year, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time pondering their definition of velocity.</p><p>They focus on four measures of developer velocity:</p><ol><li><strong>Delivery lead time</strong> is time from code being written to it being used in production.</li><li><strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is how often you deploy code.</li><li><strong>Change fail rate</strong> is how frequently changes fail.</li><li><strong>Time to restore service</strong> is time spent recovering from defects.</li></ol><p>The book uses surveys from tens of thousands of organizations to assess their
overall productivity and show how it correlates to their performance on those
four dimensions.</p><p><img src=/static/systems/dev-velocity-sys.png alt="System diagram for developer productivity."></p><p>These kind of intuitively make sense as measures of productivity, but let&rsquo;s see if we can model these measures into a system we can use to reason about developer productivity:</p><ul><li><strong><em>pull requests</em></strong> are converted into <strong>ready commits</strong> based on our <em>code review rate,</em></li><li><strong>ready commits</strong> convert into <strong>deployed commits</strong> at <em>deploy rate,</em></li><li><strong>deployed commits</strong> convert into <strong>incidents</strong> at <em>defect rate,</em></li><li><strong>incidents</strong> are remediated into <strong>reverted commits</strong> at <em>recovery rate</em>,</li><li><strong>reverted commits</strong> are debugged into new <strong>pull requests</strong> at <em>debug rate</em>.</li></ul><p>Linking these pieces together, we see a <em>feedback loop</em>, where the system&rsquo;s downstream behavior impacts its upstream behavior. With a sufficiently high <em>defect rate</em> or slow <em>recovery rate</em>, you could easily see a world where each deploy leaves you even further behind.</p><p>If your model is a good one, opportunities for improvement should be immediately obvious, which I believe is true in this case. However, to truly identify where to invest, you need to identify the true values of these stocks and flows! For example, if you don&rsquo;t have a backlog of <strong>ready commits</strong>, then speeding up your <em>deploy rate</em> may not be valuable. Likewise, if your <em>defect rate</em> is very low, than reducing your <em>recovery time</em> will have little impact on the system.</p><p>Creating an arena for quickly testing hypothesis about how things work, without having to do the underlying work beforehand, is the aspect of system thinking that I appreciate most.</p><h2 id=model-away>Model away</h2><p>Once you start thinking about systems, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s hard to stop. Pretty much any difficult problem is worth trying to represent as a system, and even without numbers plugged in I find them powerful thinking aids.</p><p>If you do want the full experience, there are relatively few tools out there to support you. <a href=https://www.iseesystems.com/>Stella</a> is the gold standard, but the price is quite steep, costing more than a new laptop for non-academic licenses.
