It&rsquo;s a great piece and a good primer on how you&rsquo;d negotiate any offer, including a Staff-plus offer: if you haven&rsquo;t thought about this topic much before, start there.</p><p>For much of your career, the offer you get is generated in a relatively formulaic way. Maybe they have a compensation calculator, or maybe they base it off your previous compensation, but it&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s system driving the numbers. However, there is a threshold where offer negotiations shift, and companies are willing to engage in a bespoke offer rather than a system-driven offer, but
you&rsquo;re expected to somehow intuit that you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold&ndash;no one will ever tell you.</p><p>This sort of bespoke offer <em>starts</em> with more flexibility around compensation, and in particular more flexibility around the equity
component of your offer.
That said, it&rsquo;s more than just the raw compensation. It&rsquo;s also about other aspects of the offer that the company doesn&rsquo;t generally have flexibility around but is willing to make private exceptions around for senior leaders.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Their standard contract might give them three months to exercise vested equity after leaving, but they might be willing to extend a Distinguished engineer&rsquo;s exercise window to five years.</li><li>They might not operationally be prepared to support early exercise for everyone but might be willing to make an exception to close a Sr Staff engineer offer.</li><li>They might be willing to offer a deferred compensation plan to support a tax-advantaged payout schedule (this is mostly a thing at public companies).</li><li>They may be open to additional vacation days if they&rsquo;re using metered, as opposed to unlimited, vacation.</li><li>They may support flexibility around work-from-home, working hours, or incorporating in a state or country they don&rsquo;t currently support employing folks in.</li></ul><p>It can be hard to know if a given role at a given company is over the threshold, and it&rsquo;s hard to ask the other Staff-plus folks already at the company because it&rsquo;s likely they didn&rsquo;t negotiate these aspects (perhaps because they were promoted from within and never given the opportunity). As a rule of thumb, if a company has more than twenty and fewer than five hundred employees, it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely they are going to do much custom work for you unless you&rsquo;re coming into a quasi-executive role&ndash;they simply don&rsquo;t have the operational ability to do so. However, if a company has thousands of folks but only a dozen at your level, it&rsquo;s fairly likely they&rsquo;re open to negotiating bespoke terms.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to be strategic about what you negotiate for. If you hold firm on First Class flights for all your business travel, you <em>might</em> get it, but it&rsquo;ll probably also send a message about your priorities that the company doesn&rsquo;t like.</p><p>Whatever you attempt to negotiate, take the time to frame your request in a narrative of why it&rsquo;s important for you. For example, I worked with one senior candidate who framed their request for an extended exercise window in the context of having just bought a house and recently exercising their previous company&rsquo;s equity after leaving. That&rsquo;s a lot more palatable than just asking for more cash compensation. The right narrative gets the negotiation done and does it without generating a negative signal about your motivations.</p><div class=mt4><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Next chapter: </span><a href=/guides/learning-materials/>Additional resources on Staff-plus engineering</a></p><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Previous chapter: </span><a href=/guides/interviewing-staff-plus-roles/>Interviewing for Staff-plus roles</a></p><div class="bg-light-gray br4 ph3 pt1 pb3"><h2>Book</h2><p>If you've enjoyed reading the stories and guides on staffeng.com, you might also enjoy
