- <a href=/stories/ras-kasa-williams>Ras Kasa Williams</a></p></blockquote><p>Years ago, the company I was working with hired a new Director of Engineering, and the CTO was talking about why the new Director was an amazing hire. The new Director&rsquo;s clinching accomplishment? The best ever explanation of the distinction between leadership and management. This turned out not to be a particularly effective way to evaluate hires, but it is an interesting topic.</p><p>Defining leadership and management is such heavily trodden terrain that it&rsquo;s hard to add much to it, but roughly management is a specific profession, and leadership is an approach one can demonstrate within any profession.</p><p>The way I think about leadership has evolved a bit over the last few years, though, coming to focus on two specific attributes. First, leaders have a sufficiently refined view of how things <em>ought to work</em> such that they can rely on their distinction between how things <em>are</em> and how they <em>ought</em> <em>to be</em> to identify proactive, congruent actions to narrow that gap. Second, they care enough about the gap to actually attempt those narrowing actions.</p><p>If you only see the gap without acting on it, you might be a visionary, but you&rsquo;re inert. If you take action without a clear view of the goal, many will consider you a leader, but your impact will be random, arbitrary, and inefficient. Combining both with some luck is likely to take you a long way in your career, and these are characteristics common in folks I&rsquo;ve worked with who successfully navigate
the transition into Staff-plus engineering or senior management roles.</p><p>But this sort of leadership can only take you so far, and personally, it took me <em>years</em> of blundering to understand why my approach to leadership created so much early success for me when first joining a company but slowly eroded how my contribution was received over time. The lesson that I slowly learned was that you couldn&rsquo;t be an effective long-term leader until you learn how to follow.</p><p>I think this is the most important lesson I&rsquo;ve learned over the past few years: the most effective leaders spend more time following than they do leading. This idea also comes up in the idea of the &ldquo;<a href=https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/rework/ted-talk-tuesday-how-start-movement>the first follower creates a leader</a>,&rdquo; but effective leaders don&rsquo;t split the world into a leader and follower dichotomy, rather they move in and out of leadership and follower roles with the folks around them.</p><p>There are many ways to put this approach into practice.</p><ol><li>Be clear with yourself what your true priorities are, and don&rsquo;t dilute yourself across everything that comes up. If there&rsquo;s something you disagree with but only in a minor way, let others take the lead figuring it out. A helpful question here is, &ldquo;Will what we do here matter to me in six months?&rdquo; If it won&rsquo;t, take the opportunity to follow.</li><li>Give your support quickly to other leaders who are working to make improvements. Even if you disagree with their initial approach, someone trustworthy leading a project will almost always get to a good outcome. If someone trustworthy is leading a project, and you&rsquo;re still uncomfortable letting them move forward, consider why you lack confidence in your ability to influence them and if you&rsquo;re bad at giving feedback.</li><li>Make your feedback explicitly non-blocking. This can be classifying a code review comment as an &ldquo;optional nit,&rdquo; but it can also be writing up detailed feedback but delivering it to someone mentioning that you wanted to share your perspective rather than necessarily change their approach.</li></ol><p>If this is something you&rsquo;ve struggled with, I&rsquo;m sympathetic. I&rsquo;ve struggled with it too. When you have a strong enough worldview to lead, you&rsquo;ll start to collect others around you who rely on you maintaining that world&rsquo;s physics, and tolerating any deviation from your vision can feel like you&rsquo;re letting them down. But this is the epitome of something that&rsquo;ll get you to one level of success but block the next: continued growth requires learning to incorporate your worldview into the worldviews of those around you, accelerating overall progress around you even if it means tolerating a detour from your vision.</p><p>What you can accomplish alone is far from what you can accomplish by creating leaders. To be a great leader, take your time learning to follow.</p><div class=mt4><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Next chapter: </span><a href=/guides/learn-to-never-be-wrong/>Learn to never be wrong</a></p><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Previous chapter: </span><a href=/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority/>Staying aligned with authority</a></p><div class="bg-light-gray br4 ph3 pt1 pb3"><h2>Book</h2><p>If you've enjoyed reading the stories and guides on staffeng.com, you might also enjoy
