There are *so* many different career ladders shared in public these days
that there's no reason *not* to read a half-dozen different ones before
attempting to design your own.

Some that are particularly worth reading through:

* [Rent the Runway](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)
* [Kickstarter](https://gist.github.com/jamtur01/aef437a79fee5a9cefdc#junioreng)
* [Patreon](https://levels.patreon.com)

You can find even more collected at [progression.fyi](https://www.progression.fyi).
Charity Majors has also written a helpful guide of [things to know about engineering levels](https://charity.wtf/2020/09/14/useful-things-to-know-about-engineering-levels/).

I think it's important to recognize that career ladders only apply effectively against
populations of individuals. They rarely, if ever, apply cleanly against any individual.
This effect becomes particularly pronounced in Staff-plus roles, which are often only
populated by a couple of folks. Ladders are essential but don't get caught believing
they're a map of how things actually work rather than a mythos of how things are intended to work.
