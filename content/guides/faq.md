This page collects frequently asked questions about
becoming and operating as a Staff engineer or Principal engineer.

### What does a Staff engineer do? What does a Staff engineer work on?

A Staff engineer is a senior, individual contributor role in a
Software Engineering organization. There is no "one" kind of Staff engineer,
and many fall into one of four archetypes: _Tech Lead_, _Architect_, _Solver_, and _Right Hand_.

[Ras Kasa Williams' story](/stories/ras-kasa-williams) does a good job of
capturing what a typical Staff engineer might do in a technology company.

### What are a Staff engineer’s responsibilities?

Similarly to the previous question, this varies a great deal depending on
the company, but generally a Staff engineer either is the subject-matter owner
for a critical area of the company (like it's databases)
or partner with a engineering manager leader (say, a Director of Product engineering)
on the overall architecture and execution in that area.

### What’s the difference between a Staff engineer and a Senior engineer? Is Staff engineer more senior than Principal engineer? How do you rank engineer titles?

The most common pattern is: Junior engineer, engineer, Senior engineer, Staff engineer, Sr Staff engineer,
Principal engineer, Distinguished engineer.

### Do all companies have both Staff engineer and Principal engineer roles?

Many companies omit one or more of these titles,
for example [Silvia Botros](/stories/silvia-botros) describes Twilio not having the Staff engineer title.
It's also common for companies to start out with fewer of these titles and slowly add more over time.
A particularly small company might not even have a Senior engineer title.
