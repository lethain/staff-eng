None of the Staff Engineer I spoke with got there alone. Most got there either through voracious reading
or building a powerful network of colleagues. This section is a collection of recommended resources.

## Your Network

Almost unanimously, Staff-plus engineers' most valuable learning resources wasn't a book, blog, talk, or paper, but instead their network of peers and mentors. If you only have one hour to develop yourself as an engineer, your best bet would be [building a network of people in similar roles](/guides/network-of-peers).

If you're looking for a Slack community, `#staff-principal-engineering` in the
[Rands Leadership Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
is a fairly lively room.

There are also many great resources on other facets of strategy as well, for example, Marty Cagan's series on [Product Strategy](https://svpg.com/product-strategy-overview/).

## Books

Although I've found that many folks don't read too many books, when I asked Staff engineers for their most valuable resources, they inevitably mentioned a personal mentor or a book. They had blog posts and tech talks they might mention related to a more specific problem, but they were most changed by this larger, more papery format.

Some books which were recommended:

* [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://lethain.com/notes-philosophy-software-design/) by John Ousterhout

If you're looking for, even more, recommended book lists abound, including my own at [Irrational Exuberance's Best Books](https://lethain.com/best-books).

## Talks

The Staff-plus engineers I've chatted with have generally mentioned giving talks as more valuable to them than listening to talks, but there certainly are some excellent talks out there. [Cindy Sridharan](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct)) is the best source of amazing talks, in particular, her write-ups of [Best of 2019 in Tech Talks](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/best-of-2019-in-tech-talks-bac697c3ee13), [Best of 2018 in Tech Talks](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/best-of-2018-in-tech-talks-2970eb3097af), and [Best of 2017 in Tech Talks](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/best-of-2017-in-tech-talks-8f78b34ff0b).

## Papers

Relatively few Staff-plus Engineers are avid readers of Computer Science papers. However, most are familiar with a handful of foundational papers, and the small subset who do spend time reading papers tend to get quite a bit out of it.

If you aspire to join the category of frequent paper readers, there's no better place than Adrian Colyer's [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/), which will send you a summary of a computer science paper every weekday. If you're more interested in getting some foundational exposure to some well-known papers, first read one of [How to Read an Academic Article](https://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/) by Peter Klein or [How to Read a Paper](https://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) by S. Keshav, and then jump into this list of recommended papers:

Probably the best place to find high-quality papers to read is [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/), which also run meetups to discuss papers. A few other resources are the [ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award list](https://www.sigops.org/awards/hof/) and [Irrational Exuberance's paper collection](https://lethain.com/some-of-my-favorite-technical-papers/).
