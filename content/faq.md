This page collects frequently asked questions about
becoming and operating as a Staff engineer or Principal engineer.

### What does a Staff engineer do? What does a Staff engineer work on?

A Staff engineer is a senior, individual contributor role in a
Software Engineering organization. There is no "one" kind of Staff engineer,
and many fall into one of four archetypes: _Tech Lead_, _Architect_, _Solver_, and _Right Hand_.

[Ras Kasa Williams' story](/stories/ras-kasa-williams) does a good job of
capturing what a typical Staff engineer might do in a technology company.

### What are a Staff engineer’s responsibilities?

Similarly to the previous question, this varies a great deal depending on
the company, but generally a Staff engineer either is the subject-matter owner
for a critical area of the company (like it's databases)
or partner with a engineering manager leader (say, a Director of Product engineering)
on the overall architecture and execution in that area.

Principal engineer, Distinguished engineer.

### Do all companies have both Staff engineer and Principal engineer roles?

Many companies omit one or more of these titles,

It's also common for companies to start out with fewer of these titles and slowly add more over time.
A particularly small company might not even have a Senior engineer title.
