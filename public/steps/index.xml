      <description>Often you&amp;rsquo;ll see a disorganized collection of ideas labeled as a &amp;ldquo;strategy.&amp;rdquo; Even when they&amp;rsquo;re dense with ideas, such documents can be hard to parse, and are a major reason why most engineers will claim their company doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear strategy even though in my experience, all companies follow some strategy, even if it&amp;rsquo;s undocumented.&#xA;This chapter lays out a repeatable, structured approach to drafting strategy. It introduces each step of that approach, which are then detailed further in their respective chapters.</description>

      <description>A surprising number of strategies are doomed from inception because their authors get attached to one particular approach without considering alternatives that would work better for their current circumstances. This happens when engineers want to pick tools solely because they are trending, and when executives insist on adopting the tech stack from their prior organization where they felt comfortable.&#xA;Exploration is the antidote to early anchoring, forcing you to consider the problem widely before evaluating any of the paths forward.</description>

      <description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve written your strategy&amp;rsquo;s exploration, the next step is working on its diagnosis. Diagnosis is understanding the constraints and challenges your strategy needs to address. In particular, itâ€™s about slowing yourself down from jumping to solutions before fully understanding the nuances and constraints of the problem.&#xA;If you ever find yourself wanting to skip the diagnosis phase&amp;ndash;let&amp;rsquo;s get to the solution already!&amp;ndash;then maybe it&amp;rsquo;s worth acknowledging that every strategy that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen fail, did so due to a lazy or inaccurate diagnoses.</description>

      <description>In Jim Collins&amp;rsquo; Great by Choice, he develops the concept of Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs. His premise is that you should cheaply test new ideas before fully committing to them. Your organization can only afford firing a small number of cannonballs, but it can bankroll far more bullets. Why not use bullets to derisk your cannonballs&amp;rsquo; trajectories?&#xA;This chapter presents a series of concrete techniques that I have personally used to effectively refine strategies before reaching the cannonball stage.</description>

      <title>Setting policy</title>

      <description>This book&amp;rsquo;s introduction started by defining strategy as &amp;ldquo;making decisions.&amp;rdquo; Then we dug into exploration, diagnosis, and refinement. Those are three chapters where you could argue that we didn&amp;rsquo;t decide anything at all. Clarifying the problem to be solved is the prerequisite of effective decision making, but eventually decisions do have to be made. Here in this chapter on policy, and the following chapter on operations, we finally start making some decisions.</description>

      <description>Even the best policies fail if they aren&amp;rsquo;t adopted by the teams they&amp;rsquo;re intended to serve. Can we persistently change our company&amp;rsquo;s behaviors with a one-time announcement? No, probably not.&#xA;I refer to the art of making policies work as &amp;ldquo;operations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;strategy operations.&amp;rdquo; The good news is that effectively operating a policy is two-thirds avoiding common practices that simply don&amp;rsquo;t work. The other one-third takes some repetition, but can be practiced in any engineering role: there&amp;rsquo;s no need to wait until you&amp;rsquo;re an executive to start building mastery.</description>

      <title>Making engineering strategies more readable</title>

      <description>As discussed in Components of engineering strategy, a complete engineering strategy has five components: explore, diagnose, refine (map &amp;amp; model), policy, and operation. However, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite challenging to read a strategy document written that way. That&amp;rsquo;s an effective sequence for creating a strategy, but it&amp;rsquo;s a challenging sequence for those trying to quickly read and apply a strategy without necessarily wanting to understand the complete thinking behind each decision.</description>

      <title>Bridging theory and practice in engineering strategy.</title>

      <description>Some people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with have lost hope that engineering strategy actually exists within any engineering organizations. I imagine that they, reading through the steps to build engineering strategy, or the strategy for resourcing Engineering-driven projects, are not impressed. Instead, these ideas probably come across as theoretical at best. In less polite company, they might describe these ideas as fake constructs.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it! Because they&amp;rsquo;re right. In fact, they&amp;rsquo;re right in two different ways.</description>
