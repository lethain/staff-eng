      In 2015, the Mini Sky City skyscraper, with 57 floors, was built in Changsha, China, in 19 days. Driving to work over the past few years, I’ve watched a nine-story building in San Francisco get built over three years. There’s some argument that Mini Sky City’s record isn’t legitimate because it relied heavily on modular, pre-built architecture, but I can assure you that the three-years-and-counting building in San Francisco is similarly being built from modular components.

      I&rsquo;ve worked alongside many talented people who spent years waiting for a chance to finally &ldquo;do strategy.&rdquo; My hope is this book convinces you—and maybe them—that waiting is optional. Strategy isn’t reserved for executives. It&rsquo;s the art of making thoughtful decisions, and is accessible to everyone&ndash;including you.
Even if you&rsquo;d prefer to avoid strategy, it&rsquo;s still happening all around you. My first big dose of strategy came managing the team responsible for Uber&rsquo;s service migration, where we desperately tried to survive accelerating inbound requests for support.

      While I frequently hear engineers bemoan a missing strategy, their complaints rarely articulate why the missing strategy matters. Instead, it serves as more of a truism: the economy used to be better, children used to respect their parents, and engineering organizations used to have an engineering strategy.
This chapter starts by exploring something I believe quite strongly: there&rsquo;s always an engineering strategy, even if there&rsquo;s nothing written down. From there, we&rsquo;ll discuss why strategy, especially written strategy, is such a valuable opportunity for organizations that take it seriously.

      If you talk to enough aspiring leaders, you&rsquo;ll become familiar with the prevalent idea that they need to be promoted before they can work on strategy. It&rsquo;s widely accepted as true, but I&rsquo;ve found this idea fundamentally incorrect: you can work on strategy from anywhere in an organization. It just requires different tactics to do so.
Both Staff Engineer and The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer have chapters on strategy. While the chapters&rsquo; contents are quite different, both present a practical path to advancing your organization&rsquo;s thinking about complex topics.

      Even if you believe that strategy is generally useful, it is difficult to decide that today is the day to start writing engineering strategy. When you do start writing strategy, it&rsquo;s easy to write so much strategy that your organization is overwhelmed and ignores your strategy rather than investing time into understanding it.
Fortunately, these are universal problems, and there are a handful of useful mental models to avoid both extremes.

      Often you&rsquo;ll see a disorganized collection of ideas labeled as a &ldquo;strategy.&rdquo; Even when they&rsquo;re dense with ideas, such documents can be hard to parse, and are a major reason why most engineers will claim their company doesn&rsquo;t have a clear strategy even though in my experience, all companies follow some strategy, even if it&rsquo;s undocumented.
This chapter lays out a repeatable, structured approach to drafting strategy. It introduces each step of that approach, which are then detailed further in their respective chapters.

      A surprising number of strategies are doomed from inception because their authors get attached to one particular approach without considering alternatives that would work better for their current circumstances. This happens when engineers want to pick tools solely because they are trending, and when executives insist on adopting the tech stack from their prior organization where they felt comfortable.
Exploration is the antidote to early anchoring, forcing you to consider the problem widely before evaluating any of the paths forward.

      Once you&rsquo;ve written your strategy&rsquo;s exploration, the next step is working on its diagnosis. Diagnosis is understanding the constraints and challenges your strategy needs to address. In particular, it’s about slowing yourself down from jumping to solutions before fully understanding the nuances and constraints of the problem.
If you ever find yourself wanting to skip the diagnosis phase&ndash;let&rsquo;s get to the solution already!&ndash;then maybe it&rsquo;s worth acknowledging that every strategy that I&rsquo;ve seen fail, did so due to a lazy or inaccurate diagnoses.

      In Jim Collins&rsquo; Great by Choice, he develops the concept of Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs. His premise is that you should cheaply test new ideas before fully committing to them. Your organization can only afford firing a small number of cannonballs, but it can bankroll far more bullets. Why not use bullets to derisk your cannonballs&rsquo; trajectories?
This chapter presents a series of concrete techniques that I have personally used to effectively refine strategies before reaching the cannonball stage.

      This book&rsquo;s introduction started by defining strategy as &ldquo;making decisions.&rdquo; Then we dug into exploration, diagnosis, and refinement. Those are three chapters where you could argue that we didn&rsquo;t decide anything at all. Clarifying the problem to be solved is the prerequisite of effective decision making, but eventually decisions do have to be made. Here in this chapter on policy, and the following chapter on operations, we finally start making some decisions.

      Even the best policies fail if they aren&rsquo;t adopted by the teams they&rsquo;re intended to serve. Can we persistently change our company&rsquo;s behaviors with a one-time announcement? No, probably not.
I refer to the art of making policies work as &ldquo;operations&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy operations.&rdquo; The good news is that effectively operating a policy is two-thirds avoiding common practices that simply don&rsquo;t work. The other one-third takes some repetition, but can be practiced in any engineering role: there&rsquo;s no need to wait until you&rsquo;re an executive to start building mastery.

      As discussed in Components of engineering strategy, a complete engineering strategy has five components: explore, diagnose, refine (map &amp; model), policy, and operation. However, it&rsquo;s actually quite challenging to read a strategy document written that way. That&rsquo;s an effective sequence for creating a strategy, but it&rsquo;s a challenging sequence for those trying to quickly read and apply a strategy without necessarily wanting to understand the complete thinking behind each decision.

      Perhaps the most important piece of the Steps to build an engineering strategy is strategy refinement. As we already worked through the overview of strategy refinement in the &ldquo;Steps&rdquo; section of this book, the goal of the &ldquo;Refinement&rdquo; section is to go into much greater detail about the three core mapping techniques: strategy testing, systems modeling, and Wardley mapping.
As we work through them, keep in mind that there are many other techniques out there, such as the many covered in Eben Hewitt&rsquo;s Technology Strategy Patterns.

      If I could only popularize one idea about technical strategy, it would be that prematurely applying pressure to a strategy&rsquo;s rollout prevents evaluating whether the strategy is effective. Pressure changes behavior in profound ways, and many of those changes are intended to make you believe your strategy is working while minimizing change to the status quo (if you&rsquo;re an executive) or get your strategy repealed (if you&rsquo;re not an executive). Neither is particular helpful.

      In early 2014, I joined as an engineering manager for Uber&rsquo;s Infrastructure team. We were responsible for a wide number of things, including provisioning new services. While the overall team I led grew significantly over time, the subset working on service provisioning never grew beyond four engineers.
Those four engineers successfully migrated 1,000+ services onto a new, future-proofed service platform. More importantly, they did it while absorbing the majority, although certainly not the entirety, of the migration workload onto that small team rather than spreading it across the 2,000+ engineers working at Uber at the time.

      From their first introduction in 2005, the debate between adopting a microservices architecture, a monolithic service architecture, or a hybrid between the two has become one of the least-reversible decisions that most engineering organizations make. Even migrating to a different database technology is generally a less expensive change than moving from monolith to microservices or from microservices to monolith.
The industry has in many ways gone full circle on that debate, from most hyperscalers in the 2010s partaking in a multi-year monolith to microservices migration, to Kelsey Hightower&rsquo;s iconic tweet on the perils of distributed monoliths:

Your software might be struggling to scale with ramping user load while also knowing that you have a series of meaningful security vulnerabilities that need to be closed sooner than later. How do you balance across them?

This strategy is almost invisible externally. Internally, discussions around it were frequent and detailed, but mostly confined to dedicated API design conversations.

Strategy isn’t reserved for executives. It&rsquo;s the art of making thoughtful decisions, and is accessible to everyone&ndash;including you.
Even if you&rsquo;d prefer to avoid strategy, it&rsquo;s still happening all around you. My first big dose of strategy came managing the team responsible for Uber&rsquo;s service migration, where we desperately tried to survive accelerating inbound requests for support.

This chapter starts by exploring something I believe quite strongly: there&rsquo;s always an engineering strategy, even if there&rsquo;s nothing written down. From there, we&rsquo;ll discuss why strategy, especially written strategy, is such a valuable opportunity for organizations that take it seriously.

      If you talk to enough aspiring leaders, you&rsquo;ll become familiar with the prevalent idea that they need to be promoted before they can work on strategy. It&rsquo;s widely accepted as true, but I&rsquo;ve found this idea fundamentally incorrect: you can work on strategy from anywhere in an organization. It just requires different tactics to do so.
Both Staff Engineer and The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer have chapters on strategy. While the chapters&rsquo; contents are quite different, both present a practical path to advancing your organization&rsquo;s thinking about complex topics.

      Even if you believe that strategy is generally useful, it is difficult to decide that today is the day to start writing engineering strategy. When you do start writing strategy, it&rsquo;s easy to write so much strategy that your organization is overwhelmed and ignores your strategy rather than investing time into understanding it.
Fortunately, these are universal problems, and there are a handful of useful mental models to avoid both extremes.

      Often you&rsquo;ll see a disorganized collection of ideas labeled as a &ldquo;strategy.&rdquo; Even when they&rsquo;re dense with ideas, such documents can be hard to parse, and are a major reason why most engineers will claim their company doesn&rsquo;t have a clear strategy even though in my experience, all companies follow some strategy, even if it&rsquo;s undocumented.
This chapter lays out a repeatable, structured approach to drafting strategy. It introduces each step of that approach, which are then detailed further in their respective chapters.

      A surprising number of strategies are doomed from inception because their authors get attached to one particular approach without considering alternatives that would work better for their current circumstances. This happens when engineers want to pick tools solely because they are trending, and when executives insist on adopting the tech stack from their prior organization where they felt comfortable.
Exploration is the antidote to early anchoring, forcing you to consider the problem widely before evaluating any of the paths forward.

If you ever find yourself wanting to skip the diagnosis phase&ndash;let&rsquo;s get to the solution already!&ndash;then maybe it&rsquo;s worth acknowledging that every strategy that I&rsquo;ve seen fail, did so due to a lazy or inaccurate diagnoses.

I refer to the art of making policies work as &ldquo;operations&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy operations.&rdquo; The good news is that effectively operating a policy is two-thirds avoiding common practices that simply don&rsquo;t work.

      If I could only popularize one idea about technical strategy, it would be that prematurely applying pressure to a strategy&rsquo;s rollout prevents evaluating whether the strategy is effective. Pressure changes behavior in profound ways, and many of those changes are intended to make you believe your strategy is working while minimizing change to the status quo (if you&rsquo;re an executive) or get your strategy repealed (if you&rsquo;re not an executive). Neither is particular helpful.

Those four engineers successfully migrated 1,000+ services onto a new, future-proofed service platform. More importantly, they did it while absorbing the majority, although certainly not the entirety, of the migration workload onto that small team rather than spreading it across the 2,000+ engineers working at Uber at the time.

      From their first introduction in 2005, the debate between adopting a microservices architecture, a monolithic service architecture, or a hybrid between the two has become one of the least-reversible decisions that most engineering organizations make. Even migrating to a different database technology is generally a less expensive change than moving from monolith to microservices or from microservices to monolith.
The industry has in many ways gone full circle on that debate, from most hyperscalers in the 2010s partaking in a multi-year monolith to microservices migration, to Kelsey Hightower&rsquo;s iconic tweet on the perils of distributed monoliths:

        How should Stripe deprecate APIs? (~2016)

      While Stripe is a widely admired company for things like its creation of the Sorbet typer project, I personally think that Stripe&rsquo;s most interesting strategy work is also among its most subtle: its willingness to significantly prioritize API stability.
This strategy is almost invisible externally. Internally, discussions around it were frequent and detailed, but mostly confined to dedicated API design conversations. API stability isn&rsquo;t just a technical design quirk, it&rsquo;s a foundational decision in an API-driven business, and I believe it is one of the unsung heroes of Stripe&rsquo;s business success.

      Many hypergrowth companies of the 2010s battled increasing complexity in their codebase by decomposing their monoliths. Stripe was somewhat of an exception, largely delaying decomposition until it had grown beyond three thousand engineers and had accumulated a decade of development in its core Ruby monolith. Even now, significant portions of their product are maintained in the monolithic repository, and it&rsquo;s safe to say this was only possible because of Sorbet&rsquo;s impact.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Discussions around acquisitions often focus on technical diligence and deciding whether to make the acquisition. However, the integration that follows afterwards can be even more complex. There are few irreversible trapdoor decisions in engineering, but decisions made early in an integration tend to be surprisingly durable.
This engineering strategy explores Stripe&rsquo;s approach to integrating their 2018 acquisition of Index. While a business book would focus on the rationale for the acquisition itself, here that rationale is merely part of the diagnosis that defines the integration tradeoffs.

Uber&rsquo;s service migration strategy unlocked the entire organization to make rapid progress. It also led to a sprawling architecture problem down the line.

      One of the hardest parts of learning about engineering strategy is finding useful resources on a topic where so much is kept private. This appendix highlights some of the public resources that I&rsquo;ve found valuable during my learning experience.
My prior writing Writing an engineering strategy is a chapter from The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer on setting engineering strategy as an executive Write five, then synthesize is a chapter from Staff Engineer on driving engineering strategy without executive authority (primarily through documentation) Books In addition to my own Staff Engineer and The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer, both of which have chapters on engineering strategy, related books that I would encourage reading are:
