if they don&rsquo;t, then they won&rsquo;t get their 20% time</li>

<p>Concretely, we are starting with two engineering-driven projects to
test out this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve content suggestions without requiring internal alignment via ML-driven content recommendations.</li>
<li>Decoupling R&amp;D from releasing new content.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<ul>
<li>hard to prioritize eng-driven projects because we have many other projects</li>
<li>hard to compare tech debt vs growth vs compliance risk though:
e.g. an investment allocation is much more doable than stack ranking</li>
