      <description>In 2015, the Mini Sky City skyscraper, with 57 floors, was built in Changsha, China, in 19 days. Driving to work over the past few years, I’ve watched a nine-story building in San Francisco get built over three years. There’s some argument that Mini Sky City’s record isn’t legitimate because it relied heavily on modular, pre-built architecture, but I can assure you that the three-years-and-counting building in San Francisco is similarly being built from modular components.</description>
