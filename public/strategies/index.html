      This book&rsquo;s Introduction started with a commitment to grounding its approach in concrete case studies. In this section, we&rsquo;re living up to that commitment by presenting ten real-world strategies I&rsquo;ve directly worked on or observed. These strategies take the somewhat abstract concepts we&rsquo;ve covered thus far and materialize them into concrete ideas, hopefully making them easier to grasp and easier for you to apply.
The first five strategies are selected to show a varied mix of refinement techniques and operational mechanisms.

      In early 2014, I joined as an engineering manager for Uber&rsquo;s Infrastructure team. We were responsible for a wide number of things, including provisioning new services. While the overall team I led grew significantly over time, the subset working on service provisioning never grew beyond four engineers.
Those four engineers successfully migrated 1,000+ services onto a new, future-proofed service platform. More importantly, they did it while absorbing the majority, although certainly not the entirety, of the migration workload onto that small team rather than spreading it across the 2,000+ engineers working at Uber at the time.

That context makes LLM adoption a great topic for a strategy case study.

      One of the trademarks of private equity ownership is the expectation that either the company maintains their current margin and grows revenue at 25-30%, or they instead grow slower and increase their free cash flow year over year. In many organizations, engineering costs have a major impact on their free cash flow. There are many costs to reduce, cloud hosting and such, but inevitably part of the discussion is addressing engineering headcount costs directly.

      From their first introduction in 2005, the debate between adopting a microservices architecture, a monolithic service architecture, or a hybrid between the two has become one of the least-reversible decisions that most engineering organizations make. Even migrating to a different database technology is generally a less expensive change than moving from monolith to microservices or from microservices to monolith.
The industry has in many ways gone full circle on that debate, from most hyperscalers in the 2010s partaking in a multi-year monolith to microservices migration, to Kelsey Hightower&rsquo;s iconic tweet on the perils of distributed monoliths:

      One of the recurring challenges in any organization is how to split your attention across long-term and short-term problems. Your software might be struggling to scale with ramping user load while also knowing that you have a series of meaningful security vulnerabilities that need to be closed sooner than later. How do you balance across them?
These sorts of balance questions occur at every level of an organization. A particularly frequent format is the debate between Product and Engineering about how much time goes towards developing new functionality versus improving what&rsquo;s already been implemented.

      While Stripe is a widely admired company for things like its creation of the Sorbet typer project, I personally think that Stripe&rsquo;s most interesting strategy work is also among its most subtle: its willingness to significantly prioritize API stability.
This strategy is almost invisible externally. Internally, discussions around it were frequent and detailed, but mostly confined to dedicated API design conversations. API stability isn&rsquo;t just a technical design quirk, it&rsquo;s a foundational decision in an API-driven business, and I believe it is one of the unsung heroes of Stripe&rsquo;s business success.

      Many hypergrowth companies of the 2010s battled increasing complexity in their codebase by decomposing their monoliths. Stripe was somewhat of an exception, largely delaying decomposition until it had grown beyond three thousand engineers and had accumulated a decade of development in its core Ruby monolith. Even now, significant portions of their product are maintained in the monolithic repository, and it&rsquo;s safe to say this was only possible because of Sorbet&rsquo;s impact.

        How to integrate Stripe&#39;s acquisition of Index? (2018)
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Discussions around acquisitions often focus on technical diligence and deciding whether to make the acquisition. However, the integration that follows afterwards can be even more complex. There are few irreversible trapdoor decisions in engineering, but decisions made early in an integration tend to be surprisingly durable.
This engineering strategy explores Stripe&rsquo;s approach to integrating their 2018 acquisition of Index. While a business book would focus on the rationale for the acquisition itself, here that rationale is merely part of the diagnosis that defines the integration tradeoffs.
