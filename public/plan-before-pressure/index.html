The belief that strategy is complex often gets people in trouble.

However, my experience is that engineering strategies fail for very mundane reasons.

<p>The belief that strategy is complex often gets people in trouble.
It&rsquo;s appealing to believe that strategies fail due to detailed
errors in decision-making, or the unanticipated move of an adversary,
and maybe that&rsquo;s true when it comes to grand company strategies.
However, my experience is that engineering strategies fail for
very mundane reasons.
The most common of these mundane reasons is that executives assume their
strategy is good enough and move to rolling the strategy out before validating it works.</p>
<p>migration however</p>
<p>However, in my experience most strategies fail because they skip
the refinement step. Refinement solves a critical problem: senior leaders have a lot of business context, but they often
don&rsquo;t know how their own company works in the details.</p>
<p>Likely the most frequent cause of failed strategy is moving from diagnosis
to the implementation phases (creating policy and operational mechanisms) without spending
any time working on refinement.</p>
<p>Explain the general role of testing, mapping and modeling for writing strategy.</p>
