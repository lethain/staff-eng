and as part of that have started re-reading previous resources
on the topic, and looking for new things to read while I refine
my point of view on what makes for good engineering strategy.</p>
<p>The best introduction to my current theory of engineering strategy is
<a href="/solving-the-engineering-strategy-crisis/">Solving the Engineering Strategy Crisis</a>,

<p><em><a href="/ways-i-help/">Let me know</a> what I&rsquo;m missing from this page!</em></p>
<h2 id="howtos">HOWTOs</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/eng-strategies/">Writing an engineering strategy</a> is a chapter from
<em><a href="/eng-execs-primer/">The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer</a></em> on setting engineering strategy as an executive</li>
<li><a href="/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/">Write five, then synthesize</a> is a chapter from
<em><a href="https://staffeng.com/">Staff Engineer</a></em> on driving engineering strategy without executive authority
(primarily through documentation)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">Wardley Maps</a></em> by Simon Wardley explains
how to use Wardley Maps to understand and improve strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>In addition to my own <em><a href="https://staffeng.com/">Staff Engineer</a></em>
and <em><a href="/eng-execs-primer/">The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer</a></em>,
both of which have chapters on engineering strategy, some interesting books on this topic are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="/notes-on-the-technology-strategy-patterns/">Technology Strategy Patterns</a></em> by Eben Hewitt &ndash; a method-focused book
on creating and communicating engineering strategy</li>
<li><em><a href="/notes-on-the-value-flywheel-effect">The Value Flywheel Effect</a></em> by Anderson, McCann, and O&rsquo;Reilly &ndash; an introduction
to Wardley maps via an exploration of Liberty Mutual&rsquo;s rationale for serverless</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/">The Phoenix Project</a></em> by Kim, Behr, and Spafford &ndash; a
modern retelling of Goldratt&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951">The Goal</a></em>,
which shows how to model and resolve problems using constraint optimization.
Previously, I would not have considered this a strategy book, but as my opinion on what strategy is
evolves (mapping plus guiding policies), I think it demonstrates a useful mapping strategy</li>
<li><em><a href="/notes-on-enterprise-architecture-as-strategy/">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></em>
by Jeanne Ross, Peter Weill, and David Robertson &mdash; an interesting read from 2006 on
the evolution of software (e.g. IT in that era&rsquo;s vernacular)  maturity within businesses,
and deciding among strategies for coupling and integration across business units</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/architecture-modernization">Architecture Modernization</a></em>
by Nick Tune with Jean-Georges Perrin &ndash; covers much of the same topics as <em>Technology Strategy Patterns</em>
and <em>The Value Flywheel Effect</em>, but often with more recent examples and references given its later publication date</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are books that tackle strategy more generally (e.g. not engineering strategy):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC/">Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</a></em> by
Richard Rumelt &ndash; the most helpful strategy book that I have ever read, because it actually provides a usable
definition of strategy</li>
<li><em><a href="/notes-on-the-crux/">The Crux</a></em> by Richard Rumelt &ndash; another good book by Richard Rumelt,
this one more oriented on how to create strategies and why strategy creation often fails.
(And less structurally focused on documenting strategies than <em>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</em>.)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows-ebook/dp/B005VSRFEA/">Thinking in Systems: A Primer</a></em> by
Donella Meadows &ndash; a book on systems thinking, which for a long time was my sole tool for mapping things around me.
This is not a software engineering book, but provides a lens into a useful mapping mechanism that you can apply to
software and software development (<a href="/limiting-wip/">Why limiting work-in-progress works</a> is one example of
me using systems thinking to model a software system)</li>
<li>*<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done-ebook/dp/B0B3HS4C98/">How Big Things Get Done</a> by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner &ndash;  a
fascinating look at why some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaproject">megaprojects</a> fail so resoundingly and why others succeed under budget and under schedule.
Connects to many related topics, such as how <a href="/benchmarking/">benchmarking</a> can help evaluate guiding policies within a strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-studies">Case studies</h2>
<p>Every discussion of engineering strategy includes a weary remark about how few strategies are
publically document. Acknowledging that concern, some case studies that I&rsquo;ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/solving-the-engineering-strategy-crisis/">Solving the Engineering Strategy Crisis</a> &ndash; is both a blog and a video that includes a short capture of Uber, Stripe and Calm&rsquo;s engineering strategies</li>
<li><a href="/magnitudes-of-exploration/">Magnitudes of exploration</a> documented a public version of Stripe&rsquo;s Engineering strategy</li>
<li><em>The Value Flywheel Effect</em> (linked under &ldquo;Books&rdquo; header above) is a good case study of Liberty Mutual&rsquo;s engineering strategy, and additionally includes case studies for A Cloud Guru, Workgrid, and BBC</li>
<li><a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/">Run less software</a> by Rich Archbold &ndash; a fantastic writeup of
a cornerstone of Intercom&rsquo;s engineering strategy</li>
<li><a href="https://slack.engineering/how-big-technical-changes-happen-at-slack/">How Big Technical Changes Happen at Slack</a> by Adams and Rodgers &ndash; this is not
quite Slack&rsquo;s engineering strategy, but it has many components of their engineering strategy within it</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">The difficult teenage years: Setting tech strategy after a launch</a> by Anna Shipman &ndash; a look at
FT&rsquo;s engineering strategy, particularly one that wasn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> defined until somewhat late in the lifecycle
(which is an extremely common occurence, even if we don&rsquo;t admit it)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more resources that are either case study-ish or engineering-ish, so they don&rsquo;t
quite fit in the above list, but are nonetheless relevant reads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">BoringTechnology.club</a> by Dan McKinley &ndash; a guiding principle that many engineering strategies include</li>
<li><a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/strategy/">GitLab Strategy</a> &ndash; ok, it&rsquo;s actually the GitLab company strategy.
but given they&rsquo;re a technology company that builds technology for technologists, it&rsquo;s an interesting read despite being
at a slightly higher altitude than an engineering strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blog-posts">Blog posts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev/p/engineering-strategy-is-a-fractal">Engineering Strategy is a Fractal</a> by Aleix Morgadas &ndash; an
interesting take on the idea of strategy concurrently existing at multiple layers of the organization</li>
<li><a href="https://sarahtaraporewalla.com/agile/design/architecture/Defining-a-Tech-Strategy">Defining a Tech Strategy</a>
by Sarah Taraporewalla &ndash; an interesting template and approach to tech strategy.
I&rsquo;m not sure if the author had read <em>Technology Strategy Patterns</em>, but many of the ideas from that book show up here as well,
but with different examples and nuance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhlxFtV_tZo&amp;t=600s&amp;ab_channel=GOTOConferences">Enterprise Architecture = Architecting the Enterprise?</a>
by Gregor Hohpe &ndash; presentation on role of IT in businesses, and also
explores metaphor of strategy as &ldquo;selling options&rdquo; using the financial definition of options</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="engineering-principles-or-values">Engineering principles or values</h2>
<p>Many folks view principles or values as the <em>same thing</em> as strategy.
I don&rsquo;t agree with that myself, but often principles and values represent a component of strategy
for a given company, and consequently are interesting to look at in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/06/29/engineering-principles">Monzo&rsquo;s engineering principles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">uk.gov&rsquo;s service standard for digital services</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collections-of-stuff">Collections of stuff</h2>
<p>There are some good resources out that collecting engineering strategy links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/awesome-engineering-strategy">aleixmorgadas/awesome-engineering-strategy</a> is a surprisingly good collection of Engineering strategy content</li>
<li>I  collected <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/learning-materials/">engineering strategy resources written by others</a> into <em>Staff Engineer</em>&rsquo;s appendix</li>
</ul>
