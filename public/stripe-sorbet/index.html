Hi
Finally, I think it&rsquo;s intellectually important to recognize the limits of my own involvement in the Sorbet strategy. While I ultimately led the organization that built Sorbet at Stripe, my organization did not include the Developer Productivity team when they decided to build Sorbet. Indeed, I initially disagreed with the approach: I preferred investing in a migration to a strongly-typed language (specifically Golang), rather than spending time on creating and maintaining a typing framework for Ruby.">

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Finally, I think it&rsquo;s intellectually important to recognize the limits of my own involvement in the Sorbet strategy.
While I ultimately led the organization that built Sorbet at Stripe,
my organization did not include the Developer Productivity team when they decided to build Sorbet.
Indeed, I initially disagreed with the approach: I preferred investing in a migration to a strongly-typed language
(specifically Golang), rather than spending time on creating and maintaining a typing framework for Ruby.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while both approaches <em>might</em> have worked, the Sorbet strategy <em>did</em> work,
and it was probably the better choice because it allowed us to concentrate the investment
into a small team rather than spreading the cost across every team within Stripe.</p>
<h2 id="reading-this-document">Reading this document</h2>
<p>To apply this strategy, start at the top with <em>Policy</em>. To understand the thinking behind this strategy, read sections in reserve order, starting with <em>Explore</em>.</p>
<p>More detail on this structure in <a href="/readable-engineering-strategy-documents">Making a readable Engineering Strategy document</a>.</p>

<h2 id="diagnose">Diagnose</h2>
<ul>
<li>developer productivity surveys: Two stages – getting data, sitting with data ← imo this is how you learn; then picking a few specific projects and driving them; together this is the core DX team loop done on a one-off basis
<ul>
<li>imperfect: always something bad, so goal is sort of rotating what&rsquo;s bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>migration of codebase will require many teams learning a new language</li>
<li>adding ruby typing will allow a centralized team to make significant investments</li>
<li>much of ruby typing can be done via the abstract syntax tree (AST)</li>
<li>we can incrementally prioritize typing on highest value places</li>
<li>ruby is not a high performance programing language, but it&rsquo;s generally good enough
and we can get sufficient scale at a reasonable price</li>
