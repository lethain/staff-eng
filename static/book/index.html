	  At most technology companies, you’ll reach Senior Software Engineer, the career level for software engineers, in five to eight years. At that career level, you’ll no longer be required to work towards the next promotion, and being promoted beyond it is exceptional rather than expected. Should you stay there, move into engineering management, or continue down the path of technical excellence to become a Staff Engineer?</p>
        <p class="block__paragraph mb-5">
	  What are the skills you need to develop to reach Staff Engineer? Are technical abilities alone sufficient to reach and succeed in that role? How do most folks reach this role? What is your manager’s role in helping you along the way? Will you enjoy being a Staff Engineer or will you toil for years to achieve a role that doesn’t suit you?
	  <i>Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track</i> is a pragmatic look at attaining and operating in Staff engineering roles,
	  building on the lived experience of folks who've walked before you.

          <p class="testimonial-card-1__paragraph mb-3">

	    &quot;It is not easy to find many resources on the staff engineer role which is still massively misunderstood due to wildly varying definitions and assumptions. 
	  </p>
          <p class="testimonial-card-1__paragraph mb-3">
	    This book lays out some of the differing role definitions and then brings them to life with real case studies making it easy to map the archetypes to your own circumstances, passions and ambitions. This should be a go to resource for anyone thinking of pursuing the IC path or that has already moved into a senior IC role.&quot;

	    &quot;In Staff Engineer, Will Larson does more than demystify the staff engineer role: he explains the whys and hows of long-term technical strategy, the power of sponsorship, and the responsibility that comes with having influence. 
	  </p>
          <p class="testimonial-card-1__paragraph mb-3">
	    Throughout the book, he references inclusive studies, addresses realistic scenarios, and offers practical advice. Staff Engineer leaves me feeling more equipped for success as an engineering leader, but more than that, it leaves me feeling affirmed — it’s the first engineering leadership book I’ve read with over half its quotations from women.&quot;

	    I think you will, yes! However, since we probably haven't met, I'm not a particularly good judge of that.
	    Rather than trust me, read one of the sections available online
	    (my favorites are <a href="/guides/staff-archetypes">Staff engineer archetypes</a>
	    and <a href="/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a>),
	    and one or two of the interviews (I'd recommend <a href="/stories/ras-kasa-williams">Kasa's</a>

	    There isn't much out there about being a senior technical leader outside of the management career track.
	    As I've worked with more folks in Staff and Principal engineer roles, this lack of guidance became
	    a point of friction for both them in self-directing their professional development and for me in trying to support
	    their growth. I wrote this book to become a more effective partner for the Staff engineers I work with,
	    and with the hope that it can help others who are charting their path to technical leadership
	    within an organization that's still figuring out how to support them.

	    The role and career of Staff engineers is a topic that deserves to be written about far more than it is written about!

	    Advice without context should always be taken with a grain of salt!
	    This book is based on more than a dozen interviews with folks operating in Staff engineer, or equivalent, roles,
	    along with my personal experience leading engineering organizations at Calm, Stripe, and Uber.
	    My hope is that this broad perspective will make the book applicable to your experience,
