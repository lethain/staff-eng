**_Tell us a little about your current role: where do you work, your title and generally the sort of work that you and your team do._**

I work at IBM on the Cognos Analytics for Mobile team. Cognos is a massive suite of business intelligence tools that customers can use to satisfy almost any way that customers need to handle their data. It uses AI to help prep data and suggest visualizations suited to data types, as well as providing powerful modelling, reporting, dashboards, and data exploration, and uses AI-infused analytics to generate insights and predictions. Since it's true enterprise software, it runs in on-prem environments as well as the hybrid cloud.

Our development organizations includes somewhere around 300 developers. My main team fluctuates between 8 and 14 and includes interns, devs, QA engineers, and a dev manager. We have an extended family that includes a product manager and UX designers. We also interface with nearly 20 groups somewhat regularly.

As far as the [Staff Eng Archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes), I was originally deployed to this product as a *Solver*. I was challenged to get delivery on track while ensuring that the move from an on-prem monolithic world view to a cloud-native one was central to our delivery approach. I've played the *Tech Lead* role several times in my career, and while I do enjoy the ability to focus on execution in a limited scope, I generally get restless. I inevitably get curious about broader organizational technical concerns, and especially the overarching strategy and OKRs. In my last job I was a *Right Hand* and worked across multiple projects that were challenged. That has been my least favorite role because you never get to stay long enough to see how things really play out. I gravitate most towards the *Architect* archetype because it’s generally a good mix of strategy, technical, architecture, and mentorship. I also enjoy the variation.

My main responsibility is enablement of Lean, Agile, and DevOps practices in order to accelerate delivery while maintaining a high standard of quality. I do this through mentorship focused on Agile code quality practices like TDD, FIRST principles of testing SOLID and other OOP principles, design patterns, and architectural patterns.

Our mobile apps are cloud-native additions to the CA family, and features multiple continuous delivery pipelines. Most importantly, they were greenfield, and presented the organization with the opportunity to find a path to cloud. This might sound like a typical scenario, but it was anything but because of the gravitational pull of our

On top of being responsible for our iOS and Android apps, our team is DevOps-capable and owns the majority of our automated testing, handles most of our deployment responsibilities, and is tirelessly working to pursue greater levels of quality and speed.

Prior to IBM I consulted for John Deere in a similar, albeit UI-focused, Lean / Agile transformation role across a group of 100 developers. Before that I worked at several companies across multiple industries. I was most influenced by my stints climbing the management ladder at the BMO Financial Group Institute for Learning, and as tech director at a small dev and events shop that ran Toyota Canada web properties (toyota.ca, scion.ca, lexus.ca) as well as the big trade shows - before they were acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Over my 20-year career, I've worn many hats outside of IC, including tech team lead, project manager, program manager, tech director, interaction designer, and information architect.

**_Did you ever consider engineering management, and if so how did you decide to pursue the staff engineer path?_**

One of the reasons I joined IBM is because they have a robust process to become what's called a Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM). We also have Distinguished Engineer and Fellow levels. Those are essentially executive positions for technical folks. I took this as a sign that there is a sophisticated view of how IBM fosters non-managerial growth.

IBM is massive, with somehwere around 350,000 employees, 100,000 of whom are developers. The level of variance in the path to Staff Engineer is high. It's mostly going to depend on the context of the group. We have levels of seniority but they are very fuzzy and I don't think I'm the right person to attempt to explain them.

That said, senior-level talent is clear and present. I've never been part of a company that is so dedicated to creating mentorship situations, nor one that's been able to present me with multiple mentors. I've had very few technical mentors over the years, but here I get to schedule regular 1:1s with multiple Distinguished Engineers and STSMs. This is a stated part of the responsibilities of the Staff Plus cohort, which is pretty cool. I've learned a lot about dealing with technical strategy at scale - something I doubt I'd be exposed to at a growing company.

As an engineer, your paths to seniority are varied. Techincal excellence, hard work, organizational skills, and the ability to move others are all recognized and rewarded. A lot of it is whether there is opportunity for promotion. Unfortunately, there has to be a spot open. Sometimes you have to convince the powers-that-be to open up one, and that can be a challenge.

**_Can you remember any piece of advice on reaching Staff that was particularly helpful for you?_**

Once you’ve clocked the organizational strategic goals - the things between the flashy bullet-points in executive slide decks - stop asking for permission and aggressively pursue those goals. Don’t wait for others to hand you the path, only you know yourself well enough to forge the right path for you. Try to stay in-bounds for the way the organization works, of course, but I believe that being a change agent is all about knowing when to do what needs to be done, and beg for forgiveness later.

**_How do you spend your time day-to-day?_**

Daily:

- For the equivalent of 2 days per week I participate in my main team’s Agile rituals.
- I try hard to code for at least 1 hr per day. That’s been elusive lately, but sometimes I’ve been able to code for 4 or even 6 hours in a day. It was critical to do this to provide the team examples of code written using TDD.
- I spend ~2 hours per day reviewing code, talking strategic adjustments, pair programming, inspecting SonarQube for technical debt, having system design, pipeline planning, or architectural discussions, or doing other things related to the core product I work on.

After that it’s easier to talk about weekly:

- I run 3 - 4 tech coaching 1:1s each week.
- Every couple of weeks I either participate or lead in a Agile or Learning guild meeting.

I have a few key groups I participate in:

- I sit in on software craftsmanship and multiple regular dev transformation discussions participate that include multiple levels of technical leaders and management.
- I have a regular working group of people trying to build out software engineering resources like a career guides and a playbook.
- I also talk with my network of mentor distinguished engineer and staff engineers on a bi-weekly or monthly basis.

The rest is a true mishmash:

- Dealing with constant audits from quality, security, and performance testers
- Ensuring cross-collaboration is smooth across the 20+(!) groups that we need to occasionally interface with
- Multiple all-hands and AMAs with executives to get the big picture
- Dealing with support or direct customer enquiries.
- Helping totally random people that have gotten my name or my team’s name from someone.


**_Where do you feel most impactful as a Staff-plus engineer? A specific story would be grand._**

My greatest contribution in my current role is transforming a struggling team of siloed devs to a fully Lean, Agile, DevOps-capable group that is trailblazing cloud-native workflows in our product organization. Our small group is at the centre of A major cultural transformation. All within 18-months.

**_Can you think of anything you’ve done as a Staff-plus engineer that you weren’t able to or wouldn’t have done before reaching that title?_**

I had a lot of these theories, but as we know execution is much harder. Proving that I could lead a cloud-native team was a huge confident boost.

More importantly, I used to be more hesitant and sought out validation of my approaches before committing. This job allows much more discretion with my time than previous ones. I believe I’ve been able to make a much broader impact by doing so.

**_Do you spend time advocating for technology, practice, process or architectural change? What’s something you’ve advocated for? Can you share a story of influencing your organization?_**

Yes, significant time. I’ve introduced these concepts to my team or organization through talks, workshops, POCs, or practical demonstrations:

- Agile Estimation
- Lean Startup
- Scrum
- FIRST Principles of Testing and effective unit testing
- TDD
- Software engineering principles and design patterns
- Blameless Post-mortems
- Value Stream Mapping
- Cypress
- Gateway Microservice Pattern
- Pair programming

**_What two or three factors were most important in you reaching Staff? How have the companies you joined, your location, or your education impacted your path?_**

A T-shaped skillset has helped differentiate me.

Being fortunate to be ride the wave of multiple trends:

1. UX designers that could code were unicorns 20 years ago. That got me a great first job.
2. Flash was hot at the time and got me promoted really quickly because there weren’t enough people good at it to effectively lead teams of LmFlash devs.
3. I went to school on Agile just as it hit the mainstream.
4. I became a JavaScript developer just as the SPA craze began in earnest with Angular (I started using it the day it went 1.0.0).
5. I got to use React and Redux early on, just before they really took over.
6. I learned DevOps just as it became mainstream.

Getting formal leadership and management training early in my career has been incredibly valuable and has opened up a lot of doors. It also gave me a broader perspective that has me including human-factors in my decisions.

**_How do you keep in touch with how things really work as you spend less time on hands-on development?_**

Make a point of reviewing PRs and taking on coding work myself. I also live review code in trunk to avoid the PR myopia. I also take courses, read books, and build silly little experiments on My time.

</div>

**_How have you sponsored other engineers? Is sponsoring other engineers an important aspect of your role?_**

An emphatic _yes_! I measure my success in their success. I was "raised" by my amazing early-career mentors to believe that your greatest personal success is how well you can elevate the people you work with. Over the years, I've learned the wisdom of that particular lesson. The biggest points of pride in my career are consistently when I see others that I've had a hand is mentoring. It's nearly as good as being a dad :)

**_What about a piece of advice for someone who has just started as a Staff Engineer?_**

Stay humble and remember you’re being entrusted to elevate others as you yourself were elevated. We’re all standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before us.
