# Introduction to refinement tools
url: https://draftingstrategy.com/refinement-intro

Perhaps the most important piece of the [Steps to build an engineering strategy](https://draftingstrategy.com/strategy-steps/)
is strategy refinement. As we already worked through the [overview of strategy refinement](https://draftingstrategy.com/refine/)
in the "Steps" section of this book, 
the goal of the "Refinement" section is to go into much greater detail about the three
core mapping techniques:
[strategy testing](https://draftingstrategy.com/strategy-testing/),
[systems modeling](https://draftingstrategy.com/systems-modeling/),
and [Wardley mapping](https://draftingstrategy.com/wardley-mapping/).

As we work through them, keep in mind that there are many other techniques out there,
such as the many covered in Eben Hewitt's *[Technology Strategy Patterns](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-technology-strategy-patterns/)*.
This section covers those that I've found most useful, and you can find breadcrumbs to
those preferred by others in the [appendix on strategy resources](https://draftingstrategy.com/additional-resources/).

With that said, it's time to start drilling into [strategy testing](https://draftingstrategy.com/strategy-testing/).
