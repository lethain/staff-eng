# Strategy resources
url: https://draftingstrategy.com/additional-resources

One of the hardest parts of learning about engineering strategy
is finding useful resources on a topic where so much is kept
private. This appendix highlights some of the public resources
that I've found valuable during my learning experience.

## My prior writing

* [Writing an engineering strategy](https://lethain.com/eng-strategies/) is a chapter from
    *[The Engineering Executive's Primer](https://lethain.com/eng-execs-primer/)* on setting engineering strategy as an executive
* [Write five, then synthesize](https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/) is a chapter from
    *[Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/)* on driving engineering strategy without executive authority
    (primarily through documentation)

## Books

In addition to my own *[Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/)*
and *[The Engineering Executive's Primer](https://lethain.com/eng-execs-primer/)*,
both of which have chapters on engineering strategy, related books that I would encourage reading are:

* *[Architecture Modernization](https://www.manning.com/books/architecture-modernization)*
    by Nick Tune with Jean-Georges Perrin -- covers much of the same topics as *Technology Strategy Patterns*
    and *The Value Flywheel Effect*, but often with more recent examples and references given its later publication date
* *[Enterprise Architecture as Strategy](https://lethain.com/notes-on-enterprise-architecture-as-strategy/)*
    by Jeanne Ross, Peter Weill, and David Robertson --- an interesting read from 2006 on
    the evolution of software (e.g. IT in that era's vernacular) maturity within businesses,
    and deciding among strategies for coupling and integration across business units    
* *[Technology Strategy Patterns](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-technology-strategy-patterns/)* by Eben Hewitt -- a method-focused book
    on creating and communicating engineering strategy
* *[The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/)* by Kim, Behr, and Spafford -- a
    modern retelling of Goldratt's *[The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951)*,
    which shows how to model and resolve problems using constraint optimization.
    Previously, I would not have considered this a strategy book, but as my opinion on what strategy is
    evolves (mapping plus guiding policies), I think it demonstrates a useful mapping strategy    
* *[The Value Flywheel Effect](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-value-flywheel-effect)* by Anderson, McCann, and O'Reilly -- an introduction
    to Wardley maps via an exploration of Liberty Mutual's rationale for serverless
* *[Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec)* by Simon Wardley explains
    how to use Wardley Maps to understand and improve strategy    

Additionally, I'd recommend these general books. They don't focus on engineering strategy,
but I've found them quite useful:

* *[Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC/)* by
    Richard Rumelt -- the most helpful strategy book that I have ever read, because it actually provides a usable
    definition of strategy
* *[How Big Things Get Done](https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done-ebook/dp/B0B3HS4C98/) by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner --  a
    fascinating look at why some [megaprojects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaproject) fail so resoundingly and why others succeed under budget and under schedule.
    Connects to many related topics, such as how [benchmarking](https://lethain.com/benchmarking/) can help evaluate guiding policies within a strategy    
* *[The Crux](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-crux/)* by Richard Rumelt -- another good book by Richard Rumelt,
    this one more oriented on how to create strategies and why strategy creation often fails.
    (And less structurally focused on documenting strategies than *Good Strategy, Bad Strategy*.)
* *[Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows-ebook/dp/B005VSRFEA/)* by
    Donella Meadows -- a book on systems thinking, which for a long time was my sole tool for mapping things around me.
    This is not a software engineering book, but provides a lens into a useful mapping mechanism that you can apply to
    software and software development ([Why limiting work-in-progress works](https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/) is one example of
    me using systems thinking to model a software system)

## Case studies

Every discussion of engineering strategy includes a weary remark about how few strategies are
publicly documented. Acknowledging that concern, some case studies that I've found helpful:

* [Magnitudes of exploration](https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/) documented a public version of Stripe's Engineering strategy
* *The Value Flywheel Effect* (linked under "Books" header above) is a good case study of Liberty Mutual's engineering strategy, and additionally includes case studies for A Cloud Guru, Workgrid, and BBC
* [Run less software](https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/) by Rich Archbold -- a fantastic writeup of
    a cornerstone of Intercom's engineering strategy
* [How Big Technical Changes Happen at Slack](https://slack.engineering/how-big-technical-changes-happen-at-slack/) by Adams and Rodgers -- this is not
    quite Slack's engineering strategy, but it has many components of their engineering strategy within it
* [The difficult teenage years: Setting tech strategy after a launch](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424) by Anna Shipman -- a look at
    FT's engineering strategy, particularly one that wasn't _really_ defined until somewhat late in the lifecycle
    (which is an extremely common occurrence, even if we don't admit it)

A few more resources that are either case study-ish or engineering-ish, so they don't
quite fit in the above list, but are nonetheless relevant reads:

* [BoringTechnology.club](https://boringtechnology.club/) by Dan McKinley -- a guiding principle that many engineering strategies include
* [GitLab Strategy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/strategy/) -- ok, it's actually the GitLab company strategy.
    but given they're a technology company that builds technology for technologists, it's an interesting read despite being
    at a slightly higher altitude than an engineering strategy

The internet is an unruly place, and I'm sure by the time that you're reading this,
many more excellent writeups will exist as well.
