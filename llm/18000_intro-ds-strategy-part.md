# Introduction to case studies
url: https://draftingstrategy.com/strategies-intro

This book's [Introduction](https://draftingstrategy.com/intro/) started with a commitment to grounding its approach in concrete case studies.
In this section, we're living up to that commitment by presenting ten real-world strategies I've directly worked on or observed.
These strategies take the somewhat abstract concepts we've covered thus far and materialize them into concrete ideas,
hopefully making them easier to grasp and easier for you to apply.

The first five strategies are selected to show a varied mix of [refinement techniques](https://draftingstrategy.com/refine/)
and [operational mechanisms](https://draftingstrategy.com/operations/).
The next five strategies are organized by the companies in which they were implemented.
If you work through these case studies and find yourself wanting more,
the [Strategy Resources Appendix](https://draftingstrategy.com/additional-resources/) includes suggestions
for further study.
