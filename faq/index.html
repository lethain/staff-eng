What does a Staff engineer do? What does a Staff engineer work on?
A Staff engineer is a senior, individual contributor role in a
Software Engineering organization. There is no &ldquo;one&rdquo; kind of Staff engineer,
and many fall into one of four archetypes: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, and Right Hand.

the company, but generally a Staff engineer either is the subject-matter owner
for a critical area of the company (like it&rsquo;s databases)
or partner with a engineering manager leader (say, a Director of Product engineering)
on the overall architecture and execution in that area.</p><p>Related: <a href=/guides/where-should-staff-plus-eng-report>Where do Staff-plus engineers fit into the org?</a></p><h3 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-staff-engineer-and-a-senior-engineer-is-staff-engineer-more-senior-than-principal-engineer-how-do-you-rank-engineer-titles>What’s the difference between a Staff engineer and a Senior engineer? Is Staff engineer more senior than Principal engineer? How do you rank engineer titles?</h3><p>The details will vary depending on the specific company under discussion, but there is a lot of overlap.
The most common pattern is: Junior engineer, engineer, Senior engineer, Staff engineer, Sr Staff engineer,
Principal engineer, Distinguished engineer.</p><p>Related: <a href=guides/staff-career-ladders>Staff-plus career ladders</a></p><h3 id=do-all-companies-have-both-staff-engineer-and-principal-engineer-roles>Do all companies have both Staff engineer and Principal engineer roles?</h3><p>Many companies omit one or more of these titles,
for example <a href=/stories/silvia-botros>Silvia Botros</a> describes Twilio not having the Staff engineer title.
It&rsquo;s also common for companies to start out with fewer of these titles and slowly add more over time.
A particularly small company might not even have a Senior engineer title.</p><h3 id=how-to-become-a-staff-engineer>How to become a Staff engineer?</h3><p>This website is dedicated to helping folks understand what the Staff engineer role entails
and then helping them get that title if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re focused on.
The best bet is to work with your manager to <a href=/guides/promo-packets>preemptively create a promotion packet</a>.
