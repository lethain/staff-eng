Tell us a little about your current role: where do you work, your title and generally the sort of work that you and your team do.
I work at Glossier, a direct-to-consumer growth-stage skincare and beauty company with incredibly passionate customers. Our engineering team is ~35 people. I&rsquo;m a Principal Engineer, mostly focusing on our Site Reliability and Tools team. My recent focus has been leading Glossier&rsquo;s Operational Excellence initiative (nicknamed ✨GLOE✨) and ensuring we&rsquo;re building scalable services and team practices. I define operational excellence as our ability to deliver low defect rates, high availability, and low latency for product features. In practice for the SRE/Tools team, that means improving observability, increasing our infra-as-code adoption, and shepherding our migration from a monolith to microservices."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.146.5"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="map[name:Will Larson]"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/static/pygments.css><link rel=canonical href=https://staffeng.com/stories/aaron-suggs/><meta property="og:url" content="https://staffeng.com/stories/aaron-suggs/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track"><meta property="og:title" content="Aaron Suggs - Principal Engineer at Glossier"><meta property="og:description" content="January, 2021 personal site, twitter, linkedin

Our engineering team is ~35 people. I&rsquo;m a Principal Engineer, mostly focusing on our Site Reliability and Tools team. My recent focus has been leading Glossier&rsquo;s Operational Excellence initiative (nicknamed ✨GLOE✨) and ensuring we&rsquo;re building scalable services and team practices. I define operational excellence as our ability to deliver low defect rates, high availability, and low latency for product features. In practice for the SRE/Tools team, that means improving observability, increasing our infra-as-code adoption, and shepherding our migration from a monolith to microservices.</p><p>In the <a href=https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes>Staff Eng Archetypes</a>, I gravitate most towards being a right-hand, and secondly a solver.</p><p>Prior to Glossier, I was a Director of Engineering at Kickstarter. In 2018, I joined Glossier as a Senior Staff Engineer (an IC role), and as the first engineer to focus primarily on internal tools and engineering practices. My first projects were building a feature flag system so we could safely and easily test features with real data; then implementing continuous deployments to accelerate delivery.</p><p>After a few months, I switched back to management to lead a new Platform team and prepare for Black Friday. Glossier has an annual Black Friday sale that generates a huge spike in traffic and revenue, and our ambitious growth targets showed we need to rigorously prepare with capacity testing, system hardening, and cross-functional collaboration (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy_-l3v9zsY">Surviving Black Friday: Tales from an e-commerce engineer</a> for details on Glossier&rsquo;s Black Friday prep). After some re-orgs, the Platform team wound down, but the current SRE/Tools team does similar work. A year ago I gave up my management responsibilities to more deeply focus on operational excellence.</p><p><strong><em>Did you ever consider engineering management, and if so how did you decide to pursue the staff engineer path?</em></strong></p><p>Absolutely! I&rsquo;ve switched from manager to IC twice in my career; and I&rsquo;ll likely do so again.</p><p>When I first became a manager in 2015, it was the only career path for a senior engineer at my company. Fortunately, ever-smaller engineering teams soon created and shared career ladders with parallel IC and management tracks. When I helped create Kickstarter&rsquo;s engineering ladder, I emphasized IC growth paths that didn&rsquo;t require people management.</p><p>I was deeply influenced by a section of Camille Fournier&rsquo;s <em>Manager&rsquo;s Path</em> that called out &ldquo;empire building&rdquo; as a toxic management practice. It reminded me of the argument in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> that the political leaders shouldn&rsquo;t be those that selfishly seek power, rather those whose wisdom makes them duty-bound to lead.</p><p>So I don&rsquo;t orient my career around ever-greater management responsibilities: it&rsquo;s one tool in the toolbox. I appreciate management as a rich discipline that I&rsquo;ll spend my career honing; alongside programming and systems engineering.</p><p>Here are some important factors for me when switching between manager and IC roles:</p><ul><li>What skills does the team need most acutely: management to coordinate the actions of a group; or an IC to accelerate the execution?</li><li>Will I have sufficient support and feedback to learn and succeed?</li><li>Am I the only one on the team who could do this; or could others do it well?</li></ul><p><strong><em>Can you remember any piece of advice on reaching Staff that was particularly helpful for you?</em></strong></p><p>&ldquo;Replace indignation with curiosity.&rdquo;</p><p>Several years ago, I told my manager about another team behaving in a way that caused problems for my team. When I finished, he gave me that advice. I hadn&rsquo;t been curious about why the other team was acting that way. It turned out they had constraints that made their behavior quite reasonable. By approaching them with curiosity and a helpful mindset (instead of frustration), we quickly found a process that improved both our workflows.</p><p>More recently, while struggling with burnout, a career coach asked me, &ldquo;What would let you approach each day with energy and optimism?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s become my morning mantra, ensuring that I make time for operational excellence and mentorship and bring genuine enthusiasm to my work.</p><p><strong><em>How do you spend your time day-to-day?</em></strong></p><p>My days are roughly 50% scheduled meetings, 35% deep-focus blocks, and 15% unplanned work.</p><p>I work hard to make sure the meetings are effective. That usually means at least having an agenda. The meeting should have a clear purpose known to attendees beforehand, such making a decision, generating ideas, or reviewing information. Meetings often have a negative connotation because they&rsquo;re facilitated poorly; but they can be incredibly productive. I try to get better at facilitating productive meetings and using synchronous attention well. <em>High Output Management</em> by Andrew Grove is a great resource to learn about effective meetings.</p><p>A technique I recently learned from my CTO is to schedule reading time at the start of a group meeting. Say you&rsquo;re in a hiring debrief: everyone spends the first 5 minutes reading each other&rsquo;s feedback about the candidate. It&rsquo;s a great way to ensure attendees truly read the document and have it top-of-mind. It ultimately saves time and elevates the subsequent discussion.</p><p>I also interview quite a bit. In 2020, I did (<em>checks calendar</em>) 126 interviews. Improving the long-term health of the team is a key Staff+ responsibility; and helping us hire great people is part of that.</p><p>The deep-focus blocks are marked off on my calendar. My company observes &ldquo;No Meeting Thursday&rdquo; which helps a lot. I use these blocks for work that&rsquo;s &lsquo;important but not urgent&rsquo; from <a href=https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/>Eisenhower&rsquo;s productivity matrix</a>. That&rsquo;s usually writing specs and documentation, or researching and prototyping new tools and patterns.</p><p>My schedule is unusual in that I stop work around 4pm most days, then work later in the evenings, ~8-10pm. This gives me several high-quality hours with my family each day. I have difficulty concentrating in the afternoon, and can more easily concentrate at night. And I enjoy getting something done right before bedtime. So this schedule has improved both my work/life balance and productivity. I changed my schedule because of childcare needs during the coronavirus pandemic; but I think I&rsquo;ll keep it long-term. I encourage everyone to reflect on what habits and schedules are helpful for their work. An open discussion with your manager and some flexibility can go a long way.</p><p>The unplanned work is mostly answering Slack messages, advising on urgent issues, or sometimes responding to a production incident. I try to approach this work with a helpful attitude, and also with an eye towards cross-training and writing discoverable documentation to minimize future unplanned work.</p><p><strong><em>Where do you feel most impactful as a Staff-plus engineer? A specific story would be grand.</em></strong></p><p>I think of my impact in two ways:</p><ol><li>Working the plan</li><li>Serendipity</li></ol><p>&lsquo;Working the plan&rsquo; is about making daily, incremental progress on a big project with a team. Some examples have been improving our site availability from under 99% to over 99.95%. It took a lot of Learning Reviews (blameless postmortems), training, testing, and refactoring. Another was a 9-month migration from dynamically-generated Rails-based HTML pages to statically-generated React-based ones to improved time-to-first-byte and availability. It took a lot of coaching, buy-in, and coordination. To successfully work the plan, you need clear goals and incremental milestones to keep the team motivated, and continuous alignment with leadership on the desired outcomes and timeline.</p><p>&lsquo;Serendipity&rsquo; in my work is about sharing an insight with the right people at the right time to make a positive impact. For example, our team was recently choosing a new vendor and the team was split between two mediocre choices. I asked an acquaintance with expertise about the vendors how he would choose; and he recommended a lesser-known new vendor that quickly became a universal team favorite.</p><p>Another serendipitous example was an engineer mentioning during standup that a caching optimization wasn&rsquo;t having impact they expected. I happened to be familiar with the config options of the particular Ruby web server; and was able to interpret some complicated metrics on a dashboard they showed to determine we had misconfigured a memory threshold. Later that day, we made a one-line config change to optimize our memory usage that reduced latency by 30%.</p><p>Serendipitous impact isn&rsquo;t planned; and isn&rsquo;t necessarily hard work. It&rsquo;s about paying attention (being present), keeping a curious mindset, and sharing the insight in a way that colleagues are open to receiving.</p><div class=pull><p><strong>Some of Aaron's work</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://kickstarter.engineering/the-value-of-reliable-developer-tooling-e94791d1482e>The Value of Reliable Developer Tooling</a></li><li><a href=https://increment.com/documentation/what-a-deploy-bot-taught-glossier-about-documentation/>What a deploy bot taught us about documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy_-l3v9zsY">Surviving Black Friday: Tales from an e-Commerce Engineer</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/glossier/the-engineering-manager-workshop-82383f810549>The Engineering Manager Workshop</a></li></ul></div><p><strong><em>How have you sponsored other engineers? Is sponsoring other engineers an important aspect of your role?</em></strong></p><p>Certainly! As a Principal Engineer, I try to be an enthusiastic and conspicuous <a href=https://sive.rs/ff>first follower</a> when other engineers are doing important new practices. Some examples are when colleagues demoed React snapshot testing and local development with Docker. After each demo, I&rsquo;d ask how I can try it out and see the benefits for myself. Then I&rsquo;d look for other teams and in-flight projects where we can apply these practices to get wider adoption.</p><p>I also &lsquo;cheerlead&rsquo;: recognizing a colleague&rsquo;s valuable effort in public or a small group, even if the outcomes aren&rsquo;t tangible yet. It could be complimenting a team that&rsquo;s was thorough and reflective during a difficult Learning Review; praising an engineer who reproduced a tricky race condition; or thanking someone who documented a poorly understood process.</p><p>I aim to serve two purposes with cheerleading: recognize those doing the valuable behavior, and give positive reinforcement in the hopes that the team does more of that behavior. It&rsquo;s really <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning>operant conditioning</a>, but cheerleading sounds much nicer.</p><p><strong><em>What about a piece of advice for someone who has just started as a Staff engineer?</em></strong></p><p>Other engineers look up to you as a role model, some in ways you may not expect. They&rsquo;ll emulate your coding style, your tone in code reviews, your behavior in meetings, your rationale for making decisions, and the way you treat colleagues.</p><p>It can feel like a lot of responsibility to be perfect all the time. But it can also bring clarity to your work: do your best, acknowledge shortcomings, be generous and curious.</p><div class=mt4><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Next chapter: </span><a href=/stories/alex-kessinger/>Alex Kessinger - Principal Engineer at Stitch Fix</a></p><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Previous chapter: </span><a href=/stories/stephen-kawaguchi/>Stephen Kawaguchi - Solution Architect at IBM</a></p><div class="bg-light-gray br4 ph3 pt1 pb3"><h2>Book</h2><p>If you've enjoyed reading the stories and guides on staffeng.com, you might also enjoy
